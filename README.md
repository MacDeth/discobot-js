Manager for the project, enable the YouTube Data API v3 and the Custom Search API.

Make sure that you've set up a Custom Search Engine at https://cse.google.com/ Once you set that up, you can find the id under the "Basic" tab after clicking a button labelled "Search engine ID". Make sure that image search is enabeled for the custom search engine. Also, make sure that the dropdown for "Sites to search" is set to "Search the entire web but emphasize included sites".
